# Manga_DiscordBot_V.2
This is the second version of my bot, that sends mangas in PT-BR.

The bot gets mangas from the web, first, it takes pieces of information of the manga and sends them to the user.
Next, the user choose if he wants to read now or add in any list ('favorites', 'readed', 'read later')
It can get a specific chapter of the manga, if it exists, and send it to the user.

This bot runs on discord, I made it for my server to be more fun for anyone.
